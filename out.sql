The high resolution and contrast Vari-Angle 3” LCD (920K dot) makes it easy to frame shots from any angle, and the 0.2” EVF (920K dot) is great for difficult shooting conditions. One-touch WiFi connectivity lets you easily share images to your smartphone or tablet – pictures that these devices cannot capture - and remote shooting via smartphone or tablet using the Fujifilm Camera Remote app for unique capture opportunities.
The FinePix S1 is the only weather-sealed superzoom on the market, and it indeed feels better than its competitors. For the more enthusiast crowd it offers Raw support as well as a hot shoe. The camera performs well in most respects, most notably when focusing,  and the lens is better-than-average. Unfortunately there are quite a few negatives: image quality is sub-par, video recording is fully automatic, and the electronic viewfinder is not great.

Its new image processor is 4x faster than that of its predecessor and offers a top ISO of 51,200. The autofocus system has been updated substantially, now offering 273 total AF points, of which 77 are phase detection (covering 40% of the frame), and much faster performance.
The X-Pro2''s body is made from four pieces of magnesium alloy with 61 seals, making it splash and dust proof, and functional down to temperatures of +14F. It has dedicated dials for exposure compensation, shutter speed and ISO. It has a maximum shutter speed of 1/8000 sec and an x-sync speed of 1/250 sec.
Other features of note include a 3", 1.62M-dot LCD, twin SD card slots, interval shooting and a new ACROS film simulation mode. The X-Pro2 can record 1080/60p video at 36MBps and offers a 2.5mm mic input jack. As one would expect, the camera also supports Wi-Fi with remote camera control.

The X-Pro2 is a 24MP high-end X-mount camera whose appeal is inextricably linked to its innovative optical/electronic hybrid viewfinder. It offers excellent image quality and some of the best out-of-camera JPEGs on the market, and comes in a well built, elegant body with plenty of direct control. Video is good but not cutting-edge either in terms of quality or supporting features. When it comes to still image quality the X-Pro2 can deliver. Whether or not this is the camera for you depends on whether you find its styling (and predisposition towards prime-lens shooting) appealing, or unnecessarily idiosyncratic.

It uses the same X-Processor Pro as the GFX 50S and has an 117-point contrast-detect autofocus system. The body is remarkably compact and lightweight for a medium format camera and it sports a 3.2" tilting touchscreen and an ultra-high-resolution 3.69M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder with a magnification of 0.77x. The top plate has dials for exposure compensation and shutter speed, while ''swipe actions'' on the LCD have replaced the four-way controller.
The GFX has the usual Fujifilm Film Simulation modes, plus a new Color Chrome Effect option. It''s also capable of capturing Full HD video at up to 30p. Unlike the GFX 50S, the 50R has built-in Bluetooth.

The Fujifilm GFX 50R brings medium format digital photography down to a more attainable price point than we''ve seen before, and does so while offering exceptional image quality in a reasonably compact yet well-built body. The ergonomics suffer a bit from the smaller grip, and some competitors with smaller sensors suffer only a slight image quality hit while being more flexible overall. That said, the GFX 50R remains a joy to use, the images a joy to view, and it''s an excellent way to get access to Fujifilm''s lineup of GF medium format lenses.

As with its big brother, the X70 is loaded with direct controls for aperture, shutter speed and exposure compensation. While it lacks the hybrid viewfinder of the X100 series, the X70 is the first Fujifilm X model to have a tilting touchscreen LCD.
The X70 uses a new autofocus system with 49 points in single AF mode and 77 points in continuous AF. It has a fully electronic shutter which tops out at 1/32000 sec and a maximum ISO of 51,200. As with its X-series stablemates, the X70 has all of Fujifilm''s Film Simulation Modes, including Classic Chrome. The camera can capture video at 1080/60p with a 36MBps bit rate. As one would expect, Wi-Fi is also built in.

The Fujifilm X70 is definitely one of the simplest 28mm-equivalent APS-C compact cameras on the market. It is well optimized for sharing and shooting, but falls a bit below the incredibly high Raw image quality bar set by the Ricoh GR. Even so, it presents a good value for those who want APS-C quality without investing in a set of lenses.

The body has twin control dials, a fixed 3" touchscreen LCD, a built-in flash and a socket for an external microphone.

The Fujifilm XF10 takes great photographs and looks great doing it, but has too many caveats for us to wholeheartedly recommend. Overall operation is sluggish and autofocus just isn''t reliable, which is unforgivable at this point considering how capable smartphones have become. But the lens is sharp, the sensor excellent and the colors gorgeous. In short, the XF10 can provide you with beautiful results, but you better pack your patience.
Good for:Street photographers using ''snap focus'', landscape shooters looking for a lightweight photographic companion and generalist photographers that have enough experience to work around the camera''s limitations.

The X100T also ships with Fujifilm’s new ‘Classic Chrome’ film simulation that delivers muted tones and deep color reproduction for beautifully dramatic images.

The X100T is an excellent photographic tool that''s engaging to use and capable of beautiful images.

Unlike other Fujifilm X-series cameras, it has a more traditional control layout and a larger grip. It uses the same sensor as the X-T4 and X-S20 with upgrades to the image stabilization system, processor, and AF system. The camera can shoot bursts at 30 fps with a crop, 20 fps without using the electronic shutter, or 8 fps with the mechanical shutter and can sustain bursts longer thanks to its UHS-II card slot and faster processor.
The camera has a mode dial rather than the shutter speed and exposure compensation dials found on other X-series models. It also has a pop-up flash. The built-in OLED viewfinder has a magnification of 0.62x and resolution of 2.36 million dots. The LCD is fully articulating and touch-enabled. A mic input is built in, and headphones can be used using the 3.5mm jack on the grip. The camera can be powered over its USB port.
The camera can capture 6K open gate footage, 4K (DCI and UHD) for more than 30 minutes, with more runtime if you add the FAN-001 cooling fan accessory. Lovers of high-speed video can shoot at up to 240 fps by dropping down to Full HD.

The X-E2S''s 3" 1.04M-dot LCD has been upgraded to a touchscreen in the X-E3, and a new feature called Touch Function puts additional customizable touch controls at the user''s fingertips. The camera''s rear control panel loses the directional navigation buttons in favor of touch control, but gains an AF joystick.

The Fujifilm X-E3 has the looks of a classic rangefinder, but don''t let that fool you, it''s got the guts of a modern camera. Handling is excellent thanks to ample direct controls, a super-responsive touchscreen, AF-point selection joystick and high-resolution electronic viewfinder. For the novice, there''s an auto switch that makes the camera simple to use. Image quality, especially JPEG, is top-notch and the 15 ''Film Simulations'' are fun to try. Performance is snappy and autofocus is reliable in good light. 4K video quality is average and subject tracking is a tad unreliable. Still, the X-E3 is a super capable, great-handling camera.

The X-T2 is Fujifilm''s most all-round capable ILC ever. It offers the excellent Raw image quality and delicious JPEGs as the X-Pro2 but gains much improved autofocus and some of the most detailed 4K footage we''ve seen. This full capability is only realized with certain lenses and in good light, but overall it''s a camera whose capabilities extend far beyond those hinted at by its retro design.
Good for:Photographers looking for a jack-of-all-trades camera with hands-on ergonomics and excellent image quality.
Not so good for:Those professionals who need to be able to depend absolutely on the autofocus system.
